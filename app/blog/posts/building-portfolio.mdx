I'm super excited to share my new portfolio site! After spending tons of time learning and experimenting, I decided it was time to create something to showcase my projects and skills in hopes for future job opportunities—and honestly, it turned out to be one of the coolest things I've ever built!

I chose Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI not just because they're popular, but because I genuinely love working with these tools. Now, you might think Next.js is a bit overkill for a simple blog and portfolio, but hear me out—building with tools that you genuinely enjoy makes a world of difference. And trust me, I haven't regretted this choice for even a second!

Next.js and React have completely elevated my development experience. I've previously spent a lot of time working with simpler tools like HTMX and jQuery. While those are fantastic for smaller or simpler projects, when it comes to creating scalable applications with complex UI states and interactivity, React and Next.js have won me over completely. The developer experience (DX) is phenomenal; everything feels intuitive, organized, and genuinely enjoyable.

Tailwind CSS has quickly become my best friend in styling. Initially, I struggled with repetitive CSS and inconsistent designs. However, leveraging Tailwind’s utility-first approach has made my styling feel effortless, consistent, and incredibly maintainable.

Building this portfolio has been a significant milestone for me—it's like seeing all my learning finally come together. Starting from scratch, I applied everything I've learned, and I can confidently say this is some of the cleanest and most organized code I've ever written. It's not just another side project; it's genuinely a reflection of my growth as a developer.

I know some might assume I'm just another developer jumping on the React bandwagon because it's trendy. But honestly, that wasn't me at first—I used to resist React, thinking it was overly complicated and full of unnecessary magic. After extensive experience building web applications with various tools like jQuery, HTMX, and Svelte, React and Next.js have stood out as the cleanest and most pleasant frameworks I've worked with. React’s approach to UI—leveraging reusable components, hooks, and managing UI as a function of state—makes intuitive sense. Plus, the power and advantages of the virtual DOM genuinely simplify the development process.

I'm pumped to keep adding to my portfolio, expanding my skills, and exploring new possibilities. I am excited to keep leanring about react and possibly other frameworks like svelte or vue, Thanks for joining me on this exciting journey, can't wait to see where it takes me next!
